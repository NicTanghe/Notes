# t1

**footnotes are questions**  

a/b  
a= numerator b=denominator  

WTF does reciprotal mean in this context. [^1]

[^1]:(i think switching the numerator and denominator but i mean the word.)


``` vex
a/b + c/d + e/f =
((a.d.f)+(c.b.f)+(e.b.d))/b.d.f 

a . b^-1 = a/b
```

Priorities 
**PEMDAS**

Please excuse my dear aunt sally

1. Parentheses
2. exponantiate !!! [^2]
3. Multiply / Devide
4. add and subtract

[^2]:*i assume that points to the what we say in dutch (dot de Xde macht*

I get the feeling this is overcomplicating things.  

you could just say first paretheses then multiplication then addition


13^2 = 169  
14^2 = 196  
15^2 = 225  
16^2 = 2^8 = 256  

1^3 = 1  
2^3 = 8  
3^3 = 18  
4^3 = 64  
5^3 = 125  
6^3 = 216  
7^3 = 343  
8^3 = 512  
9^3 = 729  
10^3 = 1000  

[^3]
[^3]:does vfx have to know anny of these
